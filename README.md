## 🚀 Collaboration Guidelines

To ensure smooth teamwork:

- ✅ **Commit, pull, and push frequently** to keep everyone on the same page.
- 🌿 **Create a branch** for any experimental or testing-specific changes. Once stable, we can discuss merging them into the main codebase.
- 💬 If you have questions, feel free to reach out to Shea (LewdLogicc)
